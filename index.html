        </header>

        <p><strong>Last Updated:</strong> June 18, 2025</p>

        <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
        <p>Welcome to Clever Cub! Your privacy is important to us. This Privacy Policy explains how we handle information in the Clever Cub mobile application (the "Service"). This policy is designed to help you understand what information we collect, why we don't collect personal data, and how we ensure your privacy is protected.</p>

        <h2>2. Information We Collect</h2>
        <p>We are committed to protecting your privacy. <strong>Clever Cub does not collect, store, or transmit any personally identifiable information (PII) from its users.</strong></p>
        <p>The game operates entirely offline or with non-personal data for its core functionality. We do not require you to create an account or provide any personal details to play the game. Information that may be collected is limited to non-personal data, such as:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Game Progress:</strong> We may store your game progress, scores, and settings locally on your device. This data is not sent to us or any third party.</li>
            <li><strong>Analytics (Non-Personal):</strong> We may use third-party services like Google Play Services to collect anonymous, aggregated data for analytical purposes. This includes information like device type, operating system version, and crash reports. This data is used solely to improve the game's performance and user experience and cannot be used to identify you personally.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>3. How We Use Your Information</h2>
        <p>Since we do not collect any personal information, we do not use it for any purpose. The non-personal, anonymous data collected is used exclusively for:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Improving and optimizing our game and services.</li>
            <li>Understanding and analyzing usage trends and preferences.</li>
            <li>Ensuring the technical functionality of our application and diagnosing crashes.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>4. Third-Party Services</h2>
        <p>Clever Cub may contain links to third-party services or display advertisements. These services have their own privacy policies, and we encourage you to review them. We are not responsible for the privacy practices of these third parties.</p>
        <p>Our use of third-party services may include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Google Play Services:</strong> Used for leaderboards, achievements, and anonymous analytics. Their privacy policy can be found at <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy" target="_blank">Google Privacy Policy</a>.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>5. Children's Privacy</h2>
        <p>Our Service is designed for a general audience, including children. We do not knowingly collect any personally identifiable information from children under the age of 13. If you are a parent or guardian and you believe that your child has provided us with personal information, please contact us so that we can take necessary action. Since our game does not collect PII, we believe it is safe for all ages.</p>

        <h2>6. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
        <p>We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page. You are advised to review this Privacy Policy periodically for any changes. Changes to this Privacy Policy are effective when they are posted on this page.</p>
